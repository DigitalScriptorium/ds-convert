"Manuscript note: See also Ricketts 47. See also Ricketts 23. The Chertsey Breviary dates from the abbacy of John of Rotherwick. When complete, it had well over 500 leaves, with a Calendar, the Temporal, a ferial Psalter, and the Sanctoral. In the early nineteenth century, many of the prettiest initials, fragments of illuminated borders and a few whole leaves were cut out and were acquired by Francis Douce (1757-1834), who bequeathed them to the Bodleian Library in Oxford, where they were pasted into MS Douce d. 13 and MS Douce 381, fol. 126. (In September 1972, these mutilated pieces were removed and were remounted together in a separate small album, now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. d. 42.) In the meantime, 10 text leaves were offered for sale by Quaritch, Rough List 176 (1898), no. 7. They had been bound up re-using the sides of the manuscript’s sixteenth-century English panel-stamped binding. The fragment was bought by the Bodleian, where it is now MS Lat. liturg. e. 6. It includes most of the manuscript’s Calendar, with the anniversaries of the deaths of the abbots of Chertsey as far as Abbot Bartholomew, Rotherwick’s predecessor, who died on 15 July 1307. Since these entries are in the hand of the main scribe, they localise the manuscript and furnish a date of not earlier than 1307. The total of known leaves from the Breviary was first increased significantly in 1960 when 158 more leaves (one blank) were acquired by the Bodleian from Martin Breslauer, cat. 92 (1960), no. 28, from the estate of Wilfred Merton, who had himself bought them from Leighton in about 1914. These leaves are now Bodleian, MS Lat. liturg. e. 37. Seven years later, 160 more leaves of the manuscript emerged. They had belonged to William Matthews, c. 1825, and to Alexander Beresford-Hope (his sale, Sotheby’s, 23 March 1882, lot 167) and to Lord Saltoun, who acquired them after their sale at Sotheby’s, 29 June 1946, lot 108, and then re-sold them at Sotheby’s, 10 July 1967, lot 86, where they were bought by Major J. R. Abbey (his JA. 7397), who was then persuaded to re-sell his new acquisition to the Bodleian. These are now Bodleian MS Lat. liturg. e. 36. Thus, a total of 228 leaves as well as an album of cuttings are now all together in the Bodleian, in four portions with four different shelfmarks. This was the position when the Chertsey Breviary was published by Alexander 1974. Soon afterwards, however, 29 more leaves were discovered by James Marrow in the Gleeson Library, University of San Francisco (MS BX 2033 A 2), recognized and published by Sandler 1983 and, with a fuller account of the Bodleian pieces, by Sandler 1986, pp. 70-71, no. 62. Finally, the Lilly Library leaves were recognized as part of the Chertsey Breviary too, apparently first by Michael Michael and W. Gordon Wheeler, and they were described by J. R. Graver in 1988.

"Manuscript note: These are four long-lost leaves from the Pontifical and Missal of Étienne de Loypeau, now Bayeux, Bibliothèque municipale, Fondes du chapitre, ms 61. The volume in Bayeux is an unusual combination of a standard Missal supplemented by prayers and ceremonies for specific use by a bishop, such as ordinations, coronations and benedictions. The manuscript has two sequences of contemporary foliation, for the Temporal and the Sanctoral respectively. The manuscript in Bayeux is lacking about two dozen leaves. The four leaves here are listed among the manuscript’s losses in Leroquais 1937, I, pp. 72-73, and in the Catalogue Général, X, 1889, pp. 235-36; nine others (not including these) are described there as being at that time in the Mancel collection, at the Hôtel de Ville in Caen. Delisle 1887, p. 534, adds that ""il y en a un ou deux autres dans le cabinet d’un amateur de Bayeux perhaps the present leaves. They were bought by Ricketts in Paris. The Missal and Pontifical of Étienne de Loypeau is intimately connected with the circle of Jean, duc de Berry (1340-1416). Étienne de Loypeau had been a member of the duc’s household in Poitiers. This manuscript may have been commissioned by the duc de Berry for his protégé Étienne de Loypeau, in or soon after 1388. Étienne ordered a copy of his new manuscript, which he sent back to the duke, who gave it to the Sainte-Chapelle in Bourges. That copy survives as Paris, BnF, ms lat.8886, and it too is now incomplete. It includes two of the five miniatures copied from those on the Lilly leaves, the Holy Cross (fol. 440v) and Saint Michael (fol. 444v). Lat 8886 is the manuscript from which the ‘Luçon Master’, or ‘Master of Étienne Loypeau’, is now named, one of the important and prolific illuminators in the circle of the duc de Berry (Meiss 1974, pp. 351-52 and 393-97; Inès Villela-Petit in Taburet-Delahaye and Avril 2004, pp. 279-80, no. 171). The hand of the artist of the five Ricketts miniatures appears in many other very grand Parisian manuscripts of the late fourteenth and early fifteenth centuries, including aristocratic texts owned by Charles V and his brothers the dukes of Burgundy and Berry. The late Michael Camille named him as the ‘Master of Death’ and confidently identified him with Pierre Remiet, an illuminator recorded in Paris between 1368 and c. 1420 (Camille 1996). This thesis depends on the assumption that Pierre Remiet was the principal painter of a manuscript of the Pèlerinage de la vie humaine which includes the name of Remiet in a margin, BnF, ms fr. 823, fol. 18v.
